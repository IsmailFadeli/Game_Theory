\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{}The purpose of this study is to describe how travelers adjust their mode of transportation choice behaviors under the influence of traffic information. Chapter 1 describes the basic theories applied in this work, including game theory concepts and evolutionary dynamics. In Chapter 2, existing research papers are studied to model the traveler's mode choice behaviors. The analysis of the equilibrium network is given in the following. Limitations of the proposed modeling method and further research directions are discussed at the end of this chapter.
