\chapter*{Introduction}
The grow of private vehicle use causes congestion that eventually  increases travel time, this increase pushes governments to motivate people towards public transport. However, more usage of public transport should be followed by an improvement of public transport services.\\

With the intention of making a transport demand analysis, it is essential to understand the traveler's mode choice behavior, where a demand is the accumulation of individuals decisions. The most important element in modeling a transport system is the mode split model, which provides a mathematical framework of the choices a traveler can have of which mode of transport is more suitable.\\

The different objectives in travel mode choice leads to the urge of applying game theory for making decisions based on finding the equilibrium of the passenger choices. However, game theory is rarely used in the transport field with several obstacles appearing in the transport characteristics. But, it is possible to predict the behaviors of travelers? this question has been asked over time, but we still do not have clear answers. Despite the common knowledge that human actions are random and unpredictable, human mobility follows certain patterns.\\

The purpose of this study is to describe how travelers adjust their mode of transport choice behaviors using an evolutionary game model. In evolutionary game theory, a dynamic process is set to describe how players adjust their choices overtime as they learn from the game and also from other players. The present document is organized into three chapters. Chapter 1 describes the basic theories applied in this work, including traditional game theory concepts and evolutionary dynamics. In Chapter 2, key studies from the literature regarding travel choice behavior are briefly examined. The third chapter describes the model used in this study. Limitations of the proposed modeling method and further research directions are discussed at the end.
